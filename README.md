# Overview

Hello, fellow developers!

I have tried my best to complete every task in this homework. It's been challenging from many aspects.
I've implemented the Book Details page, a part of Book Review option and a part of the search functionality. Unfortunately, I did not manage to complete everything.

However, I have learned a lot during the making of this project and I'm sure this knowledge will aid me in the future.
Thanks for the challenge!
